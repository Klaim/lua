Lua
---

This is the Build2 package (https://build2.org) for the Lua project (https://lua.org).

This repository contains the files in the archive of a published lua version (see `./manifest` or in this file below for the exact version packaged).
This repository does not contain the content of the archive providing the tests. We intend to add them in the future.

At the moment the only test done here just makes sure that the package is consumable and the headers found by user projects.

Released (tagged) versions will be published on https://cppget.org so if your project uses Build2 you can easilly use it.
